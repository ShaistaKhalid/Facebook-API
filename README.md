# Facebook-API
This assignment is an extension of Lab2 from week5. I added Facebook API using API code from Facebook for developers.com site.
The link that I added to my view page lets the user to add the comment by logging in to their facebook account. You even get an option to show that comment on your facebook timeline.
You get the option to edit/delete your comments.
This API code allows you to sort out the comments from newest to oldest or vice-versa.
